SynCE Plugin for Sylpheed-Claws
===============================

This plugin assists in keeping the addressbook of a Windows CE
device (Pocket PC/ iPAQ, Smartphone etc) in sync with Claws'
addressbook, with respect to email addresses. I say "assist"
because it doesn't do real automatic syncing, like Microsoft's
ActiveSync and others. It adds a menu "SynCE" to the Tools menu,
which does the following:

* for every email address that is in the WinCE device and not in Claws'
  addressbook, offer to add it to Claws' addressbook or alternatively,
  just provide a list of such email addresses

* for every email address in Claws' addressbook, check if it also exists
  on the WinCE device. Provide the user with a list of email addresses
  that are in Claws' addressbook but not on the WinCE device. Note that
  no direct writing access to the WinCE device is supported (so far).

Optionally, it warns on mutliple occurences of the same email address in
the WinCE device and/or Claws addressbook.

A connection between desktop computer and mobile device (as
described in the HOWTO on the SynCE project page) must be set up
prior to using the plugin.

The following options are available in the sylpheedrc file after
the first use of the plugin:

synce_log_level
		SynCE specific log messages:
		 0     SYNCE_LOG_LEVEL_LOWEST
		 1     SYNCE_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR
		 2     SYNCE_LOG_LEVEL_WARNING (default)
		 3     SYNCE_LOG_LEVEL_INFO
		 4     SYNCE_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG
		 5     SYNCE_LOG_LEVEL_HIGHEST
		 
offer_add_to_local
		 0	just give a list of email addresses
		 1	offer adding email addresses to local
			addressbook (default)

warn_double_addresses_local
		 0	don't warn on multiple entries of the
			same email address in one of Claws'
			addressbooks.
		 1	warn on ... (default)

warn_double_addresses_wince
		Same as above with email addresses on the WinCE
		device.

Note that Sylpheed-Claws must not be running while this file is
edited.

The plugin depends on the libraries libsynce and librapi2, both part of
the SynCE project.

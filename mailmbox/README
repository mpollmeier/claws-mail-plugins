mbox folders plugin for claws-mail
--------------------------------------

1. Experimental

  This is implemented for claws-mail 0.9.6. This may work with 
previous version. This is the first implemented folder plugin. In the 
future, interface for folder plugin may change because with implementation 
of this, we could see the limits of plugin interface for folders.
  This part is called "experimental" but in the implementation of mbox
folders is stable and won't trash your mbox (until you say me this 
happened).

2. Licence

  Most of the code is extracted from the libEtPan! project, which is BSD 
licence. But the code is considered as released under two licences, BSD 
licence and the one used in claws-mail, GPL 2.
  I hope this won't break the synchronization between the implementation 
of this plugin and the library code.

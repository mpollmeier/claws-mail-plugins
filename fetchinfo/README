Author:  Thorsten Maerz <torte@netztorte.de>
License: GPL (See file COPYING)
Depends: Sylpheed-0.9.0claws57 or later

General:
--------
The plugin can add following headers to the reveived mails:
  X-FETCH-UIDL     (UIDL specifying the message on server)
  X-FETCH-ACCOUNT  (Sylpheeds account name from accountrc)
  X-FETCH-SERVER   (POP3 server used)
  X-FETCH-USERID   (Username for that account)
  X-FETCH-TIME     (Stamp of download, rfc822 formatted) 

Please note that account, server and userid may contain
8bit characters, in that case the headers are qp encoded
to avoid illegal headers being sent when forwarding such
modified mails.


Installation:
-------------
The plugin consists of two libraries, fetchinfo_plugin
and fetchinfo_plugin_gtk, where the first one does the
job and the gtk one is used for configuration. Please
load both plugins to use them.

The install directory doesnt matter, on POSIX systems
the default destination / filenames will be:
  /usr/local/lib/sylpheed/plugins/fetchinfo_plugin.so
  /usr/local/lib/sylpheed/plugins/fetchinfo_plugin_gtk.so
On Win32, you may copy the .dlls to
  <InstallDir>/bin/plugins/fetchinfo_plugin.dll
  <InstallDir>/bin/plugins/fetchinfo_plugin_gtk.dll
Afterwards, load the plugins using Setting/Plugins
and enable/configure it using Settings/Other preferences.


Build notes:
------------
Compilation on POSIX compliant systems is described in INSTALL.
To compile under Win32, create the directory tree as described
on the Claws/Win32 homepage.
To compile with MinGW gcc, change into the win32 subdirectory,
adjust the BASE variable in Makefile and invoke "make".
To build using MSVC, open the workspace files (*.dsp) in the
IDE. The *_d.dsp files will link against the debugging 
libraries, make sure you select the right target to build.

This plugin uses Clam AntiVirus to scan all messages that are
received from an IMAP, LOCAL or POP account.

When a message attachment is found to contain a virus it can be
deleted or saved in a specially designated folder.

Options can be found in /Configuration/Preferences/Plugins/Clam AntiVirus.

Due to licensing issues this plugin does not link against any libraries
from clamav. The plugin therefore requieres a running clamav daemon running
on either localhost or somewhere else which allows the plugin access via
a unix or a TCP socket.

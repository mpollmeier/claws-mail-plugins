This Sylpheed-Claws plugin handles the vCalendar format (or rather, the 
meeting subset of it). It displays such mails in a nice format, lets you
create and send meetings, and creates a virtual folder with the meetings you
sent or received.

This GTK1 version of vcalendar is in bugfix mode; the new features will only
be added to its GTK2 version. Also, this version of vCalendar only supports
libical-0.23 (NOT 0.24-*).

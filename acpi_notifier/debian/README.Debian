Claws Mail ACPInotifier Plugin for Debian
-------------------------------------------

This is an external plugin for Claws Mail. Plugins are dynamic 
libraries and as such they must share a common ABI with the host 
application to work properly. As the ABI is currently in development,
the plugin code must check the Claws Mail version at load time so
it matches the version the plugin was compiled with. Not doing so will
result in unpredictable behaviour because of the ABI changes.

This represents no problem for internal plugins because they are
recompiled at the same time Claws Mail is, so version always matches.

On the other hand, external plugins doesn't "know" when Claws Mail
version has changed, so packages for external plugins have to be rebuilt
with each newer Claws version.

Said that, looks like external plugin packages should depend on the exactly
version of Claws Mail currently in the archive. This would be the the
easy solution, but any version change (even in the Debian version) on the
Claws Mail package would require a newer upload for all external plugins.

As time passes and number of external plugins increase this would impose
an unnecesary load on the Debian build queues. Unnecesary because the
plugins only need to be rebuilt when the Claws Mail version changes,
not when the Debian revision changes.

On current packaging there is no way to express the dependency on upstream 
version only, so the implemented solution is to relax the dependency to 
greater or equal than the current upstream version and introducing a conflict
with the next upstream version, so the plugin can live with any of the 
possible Debian revisions without needing to be rebuilt.

This solution has at least one problem: it depends on a future value of the
version string. If upstream versioning scheme changes the version range 
expressed by the current Depends/Conflicts pair may be wider than expected
and include the newer upstream version. In practice that means the old plugin
package won't be uninstalled when the new Claws Mail version gets 
installed. This has already happened with releases 0.9.12a and 0.9.12b.

To summarize, when loading a plugin if you see the popup message:
	"Your sylpheed version is newer than the 
	 version the plugin was built with"
then you have to wait until a new plugin package enters the archive.

Alternatively you may put claws-mail package on hold until all
external plugins you use are uploaded and then upgrade both claws and
the plugins at the same time.

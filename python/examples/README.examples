Unless otherwise noted in the respective files, all example snippets
are in the public domain.

Table of contents:
==================

* auto/startup
  An example startup script. It demonstrates how to modify the menu of
  Claws Mail's main window by adding a menu item under the Help menu
  to generate and browse the API documentation of the plugin.
  It also adds a menu item to mark a whole thread as read in the
  Edit menu.
  Furthermore, it shows how to build a D-Bus bridge to Claws Mail
  that other processes can use to trigger Claws Mail events.
  Also see auto/shutdown for cleanup.

* auto/shutdown
  Demonstrates how to clean up the stuff that has been introduced in
  the auto/startup example.

* main/Print action names to stdout
  Prints the names of all actions that are currently in the
  action group of Claws Mail's main window to standard output 

* main/Recursively mark messages as read
  Demonstrates how to perform actions to a directory tree under the
  currently selected folder in the main window.

* main/Mass mail
  Demonstrates how to automate composing of mails, and sending them out

* main/Create Tomboy Note
  Create a Tomboy note for each selected message, containing the
  subject as note title and a Claws Mail link in the body which
  links back to Claws Mail (requires the Claws Mail addin for Tomboy).
  Optionally, the user can choose to add a marker string for the
  Tomboy Reminder addin into the note.
  To achieve this, this example demonstrates how to talk to other
  programs via D-Bus, as well as how to query additional information
  from the user using direct GTK+ programming.

* main/Open Tomboy Notes
  This example opens all Tomboy notes which link to any of the currently
  selected messages, and thus completes the round trip from the
  "Create Tomboy Note" example.

* compose/Macro Expansion
  Demonstrates how to do text expansion in the compose window
  mail body editor

This plugin offers a Python scripting access to Claws Mail.

Python code can be entered interactively into an embedded Python
console, or stored in scripts under ~/.claws-mail/python-scripts.
The scripts are then accessible via the menu of the main window.

As an example, the following code is sending the same mail
to a list of people, one at a time.
 
========================== 8< ===========================
addresses = ["mail1@example.tld", "mail2@example.tld", "mail3@example.tld"]

for address in addresses:

	# The argument for the constructor is an email address on which
	# the sending account is selected.
	# It's also possible to use the default constructor without arguments,
	# in which case the same rules as on a menu click one "New message"
	# are applied.
    cw = clawsmail.ComposeWindow("berndth@gmx.de")
    
    # Add a recepient. There are also add_Cc and add_Bcc functions.
    cw.add_To(address)
    
    # Set the subject of the message
    cw.set_subject("Mass mail")
    
    # For the message body, access to the GtkTextView is granted in ComposeWindow.text.
    buffer = cw.text.get_buffer()
    buffer.set_text("This is an automatic message")
    
    # Access to the GtkUIManager is also provided
    action_group = cw.ui_manager.get_action_groups()[0]
    action_group.get_action("Message/SendLater").activate()

# Finally, the action group of the main window can be used to send the messages out
clawsmail.get_mainwindow_action_group().get_action("Message/SendQueue").activate()

This can be seen as a generalisation of templates. It is
normal Python code, the message contents and the addresses
could also come from an external source (such as a file,
or a database).

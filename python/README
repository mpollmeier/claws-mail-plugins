This plugin offers Python scripting access to Claws Mail.

Python code can be entered interactively into an embedded Python
console, or stored in scripts. 

These scripts are then available via the menu. You can assign
keyboard shortcuts to them just like it is done with other menu items.
You can also put buttons for script invokation into the toolbars
using Claws Mail's builtin toolbar editor.

You can provide scripts working on the main window by placing files
into ~/.claws-mail/python-scripts/main.

You can also provide scripts working on an open compose window
by placing files into ~/.claws-mail/python-scripts/compose.

The folder ~/.claws-mail/python-scripts/auto/ may contain some
scripts that are automatically executed when certain events
occur. Currently, the following files in this directory
are recognised:

  compose_any
  	Gets executed whenever a compose window is opened, no matter
  	if that opening happened as a result of composing a new message,
  	replying or forwarding a message.
  	
  startup
  	Executed at plugin load
  	
  shutdown
  	Executed at plugin unload

For example scripts, browse the "examples" subdirectory.

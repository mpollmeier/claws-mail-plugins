etPan! privacy plugin for sylpheed-claws
----------------------------------------

1. etPan! privacy

  This allow to use the privacy architecture of etPan!, so that drivers 
implemented for etPan! can be immediately used in sylpheed-claws.
This depends on libEtPan! 0.31 that can be found on http://libetpan.sf.net

2. Limitation

  Verification of signature and decryption will be handled the same way.
The result is only visible inside the textview.

3. Licence

  Most of the code is extracted from the libEtPan! project, which is BSD 
licence. But the code is considered as released under two licences, BSD 
licence and the one used in sylpheed-claws, GPL 2.
  I hope this won't break the synchronization between the implementation 
of this plugin and the library code.

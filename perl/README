The documentation has moved to the file cm_perl.pod and is now
written in POD format. Use the command `perldoc ./cm_perl.pod' in
the top level directory of this distribution to read
it. Alternatively, you can use `pod2man' (which is part of the
Perl distribution) to generate a man page.

Also, don't forget to check out the NEWS file.

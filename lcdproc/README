                            Sylpheed LCDProc Plugin

   This is a simple but useful plugin for [1]Sylpheed. Currently it only
   supports the [2]Claws branch, since "Sylpheed Main" doesn't support
   plugins yet.

   If you have an external LCD module, like the ones made by Matrix
   Orbital or CristalFontz, or even one of those
   cheap-and-easy-to-assemble HD44780-based ones, you'll be able to see
   the number of unread/new messages. This requires a [3]LCDProc (version
   0.43 was used in development, newer -- or older -- versions may or not
   be used) server up and running.

   Actual version doesn't supports runtime configuration, so if your
   server isn't running on 127.0.0.1:13666 you'll need to change two
   variables in the source code (lcdproc.c). It was developed with a 16x2
   screen in mind, so it'll show too little information if you have a
   bigger display; please send me a patch to correct this if you need.

   You'll also need Sylpheed-Claws version 0.8.11 (only from CVS at the
   time I write this) or better. Newer versions may not work as the
   plugin system matures and changes its API.

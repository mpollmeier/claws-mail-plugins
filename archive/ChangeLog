        Fix a bug which was causing files not to be included in archive.
        The reason was if the user had chosen to use descriptive names
        for files in archive and if a descriptive name was not able to be
        constructed then the file was silently dropped from archive.
        Add a fall-back to simply use the mail number instead which will
        then reinstate the message in archive again.

        Added to new features:
        1) Instruct archiver to only include messages before a certain date.
           Date is compared against the files creation time (mtime)
        2) An option to instruct the archiver to delete messages after
           successfully adding them to archiver (1 run to create archive
           and a second run to delete messages)

Todo in the coming releases:

1) Make the archiver available from a script or via the commandline

Future improvements:

1) Create folders which (de)compress on the fly
    - This requires the use of libarchives feature to read/write from
    memory and be able to make this chunk of memory persistent in the
    file system.
2) Restore items from archive
    - Allow the user to restore from a chosen archive and even, if the
    user wants that, to have chosen mails re-injected on the server

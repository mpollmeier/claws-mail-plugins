This plugin collects various ways to notify the user of new (and
possibly unread) mail. Currently, command execution, a popup, a mail
banner, a LCDProc client and a trayicon are implemented.

You can configure the plugin via the Preferences - Plugins menu.

All modules can be deactivated at compile time.
